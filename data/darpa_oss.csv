(2) Foundational: The output of a Bedrock verification is a theorem whose statement depends only on the predicates you choose to use in the key specifications and on the operational semantics of a simple cross-platform machine language. That is, you don't need to trust that the verification framework is bug-free; rather, you need to trust the usual Coq proof-checker and the formalization of the machine language semantics. Higher-order: Bedrock facilitates quite pleasant reasoning about code pointers as data. (3) Computational: Many useful functions are specified most effectively by comparing with ""reference implementations"" in a pure functional language. Bedrock supports that model, backed by the full expressive power of Coq's usual programming language. (4) Structured: Bedrock is an extensible programming language: any client program may add new control flow constructs by providing their proof rules. For example, adding high-level syntax for your own calling convention or exception handling construct is relatively straightforward and does not require tweaking the core library code. (5) Mostly automated: Tactics automate verification condition generation (in a form inspired by separation logic) and most of the process of discharging those conditions.

The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. To address this, we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. 
UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes.
Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. UpSet also introduces several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability.
